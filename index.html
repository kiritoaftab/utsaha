        <h1>About UTSAHA</h1>
        <p>Utsaha is a techno-cultural fest, held annually during the even semester of each academic year. The first edition of Utsaha was held in 2004 and has been growing ever since. What was started as an interdepartmental fest, is now an inter-college fest with students from various colleges across the state actively participating and competing in the extravagant events. Utsaha is a combined effort of students and faculty from all branches, giving everybody an opportunity to develop and boost their organization and management skills. The fest is a result of continuous and consistent efforts of the students over a period of two to three months prior to the fest. Students engross themselves in the creative activities of designing and decorating the campus in time for the event so that the campus has the festive mood the students are in. Several marketing techniques are also imbibed so that the fest gets adequate popularity among the college students throughout the city and they turn up to have a great time in one of the best colleges in the city. On-stage events like Singing, Dancing, Beat Boxing, Street Dancing and Fashion Show get the crowd going while off-stage events like Treasure Hunts, Quizzes, Coding events, etc., attract competitive souls. Apart from all these events, we also have sports like Basketball, Football, Cricket, and Volleyball for the sportsperson. All the winners are awarded with attractive cash prizes, mementos, and certificates while it is ensured that every participant in every event is presented with a participation certificate. Each year, we have celebrities inaugurating the events, followed by performances by artists, which are enjoyed by students and teachers alike. It is ensured that the league of artists is well endowed with famous artists as well rookies who are looking for a big stage to perform. Utsaha 2016 had more than 6000 students taking part enthusiastically in the fest, one of the highest footfalls among the college fests of Bangalore. This year, we plan to raise the number even higher, to make Utsaha the largest in the capital. You will love my event because of celebrities, social Media, extensive media coverage, audience quality, and the opportunities for brand integration. </p>
